## 🚀 **Featured Projects**  

🔹 Weather App (Django + OpenWeatherMap API)
☁️ Built a web app that pulls real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, UV index, air quality) from OpenWeatherMap. Helped me understand API integration and backend/frontend communication.

🔹 Automated Email System (Power Automate)
📧 Used Microsoft Power Automate to send personalized email campaigns based on Excel data. Built flow logic to automate notifications — super handy for repetitive communication tasks.

🔹 Asterisk PBX Dial Plan (CLI)
📞 Configured a basic phone system using backend scripting and logic via the Asterisk CLI. Focused on call flow, routing, and subscriber control — all done without a GUI.

🔹 Server/Client Communication System (C – Windows/Linux)
🔗 Designed a cross-platform server-client architecture using sockets. This project sharpened my understanding of real-time communication, threading, and network protocols.

🔹 Hybrid Image Generator (Python)
🖼 Blended two images by combining their frequency layers (low-pass and high-pass) using FFT in Python. It was a creative dive into digital signal processing and algorithm design.
